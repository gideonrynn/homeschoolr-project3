# User Story
As a PARENT
I want to SCHEDULE blocks of time for my child to complete school work
and NOTIFY their teacher of any at home work issues
to help MAINTAIN a regular work schedule in the event that my child is kept home from school for an extended period of time

As a TEACHER
in the event of sudden long-term school closure
I want to help parents SCHEDULE their student's at-home schoolwork
and TRACK daily student goals 
so that I can MONITOR student progress remotely
